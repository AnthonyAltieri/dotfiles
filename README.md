Managed with Nix using `nix-darwin` for macOS and Home Manager for user configuration.

For the full architecture walkthrough, see [`docs/nix/README.md`](docs/nix/README.md).

## Configuration model

This repo composes configuration on two axes:

- **Role**
  - `common` — shared configuration for personal and work machines
  - `personal` — `common + personal`
  - `work` — `common + work`
  - `sandbox` — standalone profile for agent sandboxes
- **Platform**
  - `darwin` — `nix-darwin` system modules, Homebrew integration, macOS defaults
  - `linux` — Home Manager plus Nix packages

The resulting outputs are:

- `darwinConfigurations.personal`
- `darwinConfigurations.work`
- `homeConfigurations.personal-linux`
- `homeConfigurations.personal-aarch64-linux`
- `homeConfigurations.work-linux`
- `homeConfigurations.work-aarch64-linux`
- `homeConfigurations.sandbox-aarch64-darwin`
- `homeConfigurations.sandbox-aarch64-linux`
- `homeConfigurations.sandbox-x86_64-linux`

```

`home/` stores the managed payloads using their real target names, so the tree matches the home directory layout Home Manager deploys.

## Bootstrap on macOS

`bootstrap.sh` is the supported macOS apply path. It is safe to rerun after pulling changes or editing the flake. It installs missing prerequisites only, reloads Nix and Homebrew when they already exist, then reapplies the selected Darwin role.

Run bootstrap as your normal user. On a real apply, the script uses `sudo` only for the final `darwin-rebuild switch` step.

First-time prerequisite install:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh install-dependencies
```

```bash
./bootstrap.sh personal
./bootstrap.sh work
```

Preview without switching:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh personal --dry-run
./bootstrap.sh personal --dry-run --diff
```

`--dry-run` is available only after Nix is already installed on the machine. On a fresh Mac, run `./bootstrap.sh install-dependencies` first.

Show a closure diff before a real apply:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh personal --diff
./bootstrap.sh work --diff
```

During a real apply, Home Manager backs up conflicting managed files with the `.hm-backup` suffix before replacing them.

On the first real nix-darwin apply, bootstrap may also stop before activation if macOS still has unmanaged `/etc/bashrc` or `/etc/zshrc` content. In that case, rename the flagged files to `*.before-nix-darwin` once and rerun bootstrap.

The deeper explanation of what bootstrap does and how the flake composes roles and platforms lives in [`docs/nix/README.md`](docs/nix/README.md).

## Day-to-day usage

On macOS, rerunning bootstrap is the simplest path:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh personal
./bootstrap.sh work
```

If you want to preview first:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh personal --dry-run --diff
./bootstrap.sh work --dry-run --diff
```

You can still apply the Darwin role directly if you want the native command:

```bash
darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#personal
darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#work
```

Apply a Linux profile:

```bash
home-manager switch --flake .#personal-linux
home-manager switch --flake .#personal-aarch64-linux
home-manager switch --flake .#work-linux
home-manager switch --flake .#work-aarch64-linux
```

Apply a sandbox profile:

```bash
home-manager switch --flake .#sandbox-aarch64-darwin
home-manager switch --flake .#sandbox-aarch64-linux
home-manager switch --flake .#sandbox-x86_64-linux
```

Update flake inputs:

```bash
nix flake update
```

## Package strategy

- **Darwin** uses Homebrew through `modules/platforms/darwin/homebrew.nix`.
- **Linux** uses Nix packages through `modules/platforms/linux/packages.nix`.
- **Sandbox** stays lean and avoids desktop-specific settings.

Current hidden runtime dependencies are also declared, including `jq`.

## Managed vs unmanaged files

This repo manages a curated subset of `~/.codex` and `~/.claude`.

Managed agent files include:

- `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`
- `~/.codex/prompts/pr.md`
- `~/.codex/rules/default.rules`
- `~/.codex/skills/{atlas,frontend-design,gh-address-comments,gh-fix-ci,gh-manage-pr,notion-knowledge-capture,programming,sql-read}`
- `~/.claude/skills/{frontend-design,gh-address-comments,gh-fix-ci,gh-manage-pr,programming,sql-read}`

Rust-backed helper commands such as `atlas-cli`, `fetch-comments`, `classify-ci-log`, `gh-manage-pr-summarize`, and `sql-read` are built from the managed source trees and exposed on `PATH` by the active profile.

Examples of intentionally unmanaged local state:

- `~/.codex/config.toml`
- `~/.codex/auth.json`
- `~/.codex/history.jsonl`
- `~/.codex/sessions/**`
- `~/.codex/worktrees/**`
- `~/.codex/sqlite/**`
- `~/.codex/log/**`
- machine-local Claude/Codex runtime state

## Where changes go

- role-specific policy: `modules/roles/`
- platform-specific policy: `modules/platforms/`
- shared Home Manager behavior: `modules/shared/`
- raw config payloads: `home/`

## Verification

Once Nix is available on the target machine, run:

```bash
nix flake check
nix build .#darwinConfigurations.personal.system
nix build .#darwinConfigurations.work.system
nix build .#homeConfigurations.personal-linux.activationPackage
nix build .#homeConfigurations.work-linux.activationPackage
nix build .#homeConfigurations.sandbox-aarch64-darwin.activationPackage
nix build .#homeConfigurations.sandbox-aarch64-linux.activationPackage
nix build .#homeConfigurations.sandbox-x86_64-linux.activationPackage
```

`flake.lock` is not generated in this workspace because `nix` is not installed here. Generate it with `nix flake lock` on a machine with Nix available before relying on reproducible input pinning.

## Docker smoke tests

Ubuntu LTS smoke tests are available through Docker and validate the Linux Home Manager profiles in a fresh `ubuntu:24.04` container:

```bash
./tests/run-linux-docker-smoke.sh
```

By default the runner tests the three logical Linux roles, `personal`, `work`, and `sandbox`, and maps each one to the correct Linux output for the container architecture.

You can also target specific roles:

```bash
./tests/run-linux-docker-smoke.sh personal
./tests/run-linux-docker-smoke.sh work
./tests/run-linux-docker-smoke.sh sandbox
```

The Docker harness installs Nix inside the container, evaluates the Linux Home Manager profile that corresponds to the requested role and container architecture, and asserts key managed files, package selections, and profile-specific behavior such as Oh My Zsh being present on `personal` and `work` but absent on `sandbox`.

If you want to force full activation as well, set `FULL_ACTIVATE=1`:

```bash
FULL_ACTIVATE=1 ./tests/run-linux-docker-smoke.sh
```

Full activation pulls a much larger Nix closure and can exceed typical Docker Desktop disk budgets. Docker does not cover `nix-darwin`, Homebrew integration, or the macOS bootstrap path.
